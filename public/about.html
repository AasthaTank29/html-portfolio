<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Aastha Tank, currently in my second year pursuing a BCA degree. I am passionate about becoming a Full Stack Developer and have been honing my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, Bootstrap, and MySQL for database management. In my academic journey, I take pride in securing the 2nd rank in BCA during both the 1st and 2nd semesters. Recently, I participated in the New India Vibrant Hackathon 2023 and was honored with a certificate for my contribution.
  While I am still a student and haven't accumulated professional work experience, my dedication to learning and achieving extends beyond the classroom.
  On a personal note, I am a devoted follower of BAPS Swaminarayan. The values and teachings from this spiritual path greatly influence my approach to life and learning.
  Feel free to explore my web projects and connect with me. I am always eager to collaborate and continue my journey in the ever-evolving world of technology.</p>
  <p>In addition to my academic pursuits, I'm passionate about turning concepts into reality through hands-on projects. One notable project is the creation of a website for Aastha Construction, where I employed a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in web development while contributing to the digital presence of a construction venture.</p>
  <p>Looking ahead, my goal is to further refine my skills as a Full Stack Developer. I'm excited about the prospect of taking on new challenges and contributing to innovative projects in the tech industry.</p>
